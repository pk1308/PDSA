**Summary**
Depth First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the graph in a depth-first manner. It starts at a vertex, visits all of its unvisited neighbors, and then recurses to explore each of those neighbors' unvisited neighbors. This process continues until all vertices have been visited.

DFS uses a stack to keep track of the vertices that have been visited but not yet explored. When a vertex is visited, it is pushed onto the stack. When all of the vertex's neighbors have been explored, it is popped off the stack.

DFS is useful for finding paths through graphs, and it can also be used to find connected components in a graph.

The complexity of DFS is O(n + m), where n is the number of vertices in the graph and m is the number of edges.
