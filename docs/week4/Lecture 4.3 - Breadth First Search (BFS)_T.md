**Summary**
Breadth First Search (BFS) is a systematic strategy for exploring a graph. It involves marking which vertices have been visited and using a queue to keep track of which have yet to be explored.

Using an adjacency matrix requires n^2 time, regardless of edges. To optimize, adjacency lists are used, resulting in m+n time, where m is the number of edges and n is the number of vertices.

BFS can be extended to maintain parent information for path recovery and level information for recording shortest path length. However, shortest path in terms of edges may not always indicate the shortest path in distance.
