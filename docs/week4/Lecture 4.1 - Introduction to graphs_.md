**Summary**
**Graphs**

Graphs are used to visually represent relationships between entities. Entities are represented as vertices (nodes), and relationships are represented as edges. Graphs can be directed (edges have a specific direction) or undirected (edges do not have a specific direction).

**Paths and Reachability**

A path is a sequence of connected edges. Reachability determines if there is a path from one vertex to another.

**Graph Applications**

Graphs have numerous practical applications, including:

* **Map Colouring:** Determining the minimum number of colors needed to colour a map so that adjacent areas have different colors.
* **Graph Colouring:** Assigning colors to vertices such that adjacent vertices have different colors.
* **Vertex Cover:** Finding the minimum set of vertices that cover all edges.
* **Independent Set:** Identifying a set of vertices where no two vertices are connected by an edge.
* **Matching:** Finding a set of non-overlapping edges that connect pairs of vertices.

**Concept Overview**

* Graphs represent relationships between entities.
* Directed graphs have edges with specific directions, while undirected graphs do not.
* Reachability is used to determine if one vertex can reach another through a path.
* Graph applications include map colouring, graph colouring, vertex cover, independent set, and matching.
