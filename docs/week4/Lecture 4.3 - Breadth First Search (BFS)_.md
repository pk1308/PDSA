**Summary**
**Summary of Breadth First Search (BFS):**

BFS is a systematic technique for exploring a graph level by level. It involves:
- Marking visited vertices
- Maintaining a queue of explored but unvisited vertices
- Complexity: O(nÂ²) using an adjacency matrix or O(m + n) using an adjacency list

**Enhancing BFS:**
- Maintain parent information to recover the path to reachable vertices.
- Record distance (levels) to identify the shortest path in terms of edge count.

**Generalizations:**
- Edges can have weights (costs).
- In weighted graphs, shortest paths are determined by cost, not edge count.
