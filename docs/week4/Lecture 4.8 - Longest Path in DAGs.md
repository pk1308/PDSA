**Summary**
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are graphs without directed cycles. Topological sorting provides a feasible schedule by enumerating vertices from the graph with no incoming edges to vertices with the highest number of incoming edges. The longest path in a DAG can be found by iterating through the vertices in topological order and checking if there is a longer path to each vertex from its incoming neighbors. The longest path problem in general graphs, however, is more difficult, and the best-known strategy involves enumerating all possible paths.
