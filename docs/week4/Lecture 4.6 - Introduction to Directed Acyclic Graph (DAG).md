**Summary**
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) are graphical representations of tasks with dependencies. They are used to organize and schedule tasks, ensuring that tasks that must be completed before others are done first.

DAGs consist of vertices (tasks) and edges (dependencies). An arrow from vertex A to vertex B indicates that task A must be completed before task B can begin.

Typical questions addressed using DAGs include scheduling tasks while respecting dependencies and estimating the time required to complete all tasks.

In a DAG, topological sorting finds a valid ordering of tasks, and finding the longest path determines the longest sequence of dependent tasks, providing an estimate of the time required to complete the project.
