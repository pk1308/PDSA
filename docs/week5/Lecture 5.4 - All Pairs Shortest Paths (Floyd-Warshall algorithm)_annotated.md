# Lecture 5.4 - All Pairs Shortest Paths (Floyd-Warshall algorithm)_annotated.pdf (PDF file)
**Summary**
The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is a method for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. It works by iteratively updating a matrix of distances between all pairs of vertices, until the matrix contains the shortest paths. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the number of vertices in the graph.

An alternative approach is to use Warshall's algorithm, which can be used to compute the transitive closure of a graph. The transitive closure of a graph is a matrix that indicates whether there is a path from every vertex to every other vertex in the graph. Warshall's algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the number of vertices in the graph.

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be used to solve a variety of problems, such as finding the shortest path between two cities in a road network, or finding the minimum cost of a set of tasks that must be performed in a given order.
