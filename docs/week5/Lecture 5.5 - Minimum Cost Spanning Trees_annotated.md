**Summary**
Minimum Cost Spanning Trees (MCSTs) are used to connect a set of nodes with the minimum total cost. They have applications in areas such as road construction and network design. A tree is a graph with no cycles, and a spanning tree is a tree that connects all the nodes in a graph. A MCST is a spanning tree with the minimum total edge weight.

MCSTs can be constructed using Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm. Kruskal's algorithm sorts the edges in ascending order of weight and adds them to the MCST until all nodes are connected. Prim's algorithm starts with a single node and iteratively adds the lowest-cost edge that connects an existing node to an unconnected node.

Some facts about trees that are useful for building MCSTs include:
- A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.
- Adding an edge to a tree creates a cycle.
- Every pair of vertices in a tree is connected by a unique path.
