# Lecture 5.1 - Shortest Paths in Weighted Graphs_annotated.pdf (PDF file)
**Summary**
In weighted graphs, edges have assigned values (costs). Shortest paths in weighted graphs consider the total cost of the path rather than the number of edges. This can lead to different results compared to unweighted graphs.

Two common shortest path problems are:

* **Single Source Shortest Paths**: Finding the shortest path from a specified vertex to all other vertices.
* **All Pairs Shortest Paths**: Finding the shortest path between every pair of vertices.

Negative edge weights can be meaningful in certain scenarios, such as modeling costs in a taxi system where some roads have negative weights due to earning revenue. However, negative edge weights can also lead to negative cycles, which hinder the definition of shortest paths. Graphs without negative cycles allow for shortest path computations even with negative weights.
