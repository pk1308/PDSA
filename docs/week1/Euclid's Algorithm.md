**Euclid's Algorithm**

Euclid's Algorithm is an efficient method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers. The GCD is the largest number that divides both integers without leaving a remainder.

**The Algorithm:**

1. **Base Case:** If one of the numbers is 0, the GCD is the other number.
2. **Recursive Step:** While the second number is not 0:
   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and get the remainder.
   - Set the larger number to the previous smaller number.
   - Set the smaller number to the remainder obtained in the previous step.
3. **Return:** Once the second number becomes 0, the GCD is the value stored in the first number (which was originally the larger number).

**Advantages:**

- Efficient: Euclid's Algorithm has a time complexity of O(log(min(a, b))), where a and b are the two integers. This means it's relatively fast, especially for larger numbers.
- Simple to understand and implement.

**Python Implementation:**

```python
def gcd(a, b):
  """
  This function implements Euclid's Algorithm to find the GCD of two positive integers.

  Args:
      a: The first positive integer.
      b: The second positive integer.

  Returns:
      The GCD of a and b.
  """

  a, b = max(a,b) , min(a,b)
  while b != 0:
    remainder = a % b
    a = b
    b = remainder
  return a

# Example usage
num1 = 97
num2 = 2
gcd_result = gcd(num1, num2)
print(f"The GCD of {num1} and {num2} is: {gcd_result}")
```

```python
def gcd( m : int , n : int )-> int:
  """
  This function implements Euclid's Algorithm to find the GCD of two positive integers.

  Args:
      m: The first positive integer.
      n: The second positive integer.

  Returns:
      The GCD of m and n.
  """
    (a, b) = (max(m,n) , min(m,n))
    print(f" a: {a} , b:{b}")
    if a%b == 0:
        return b 
    else:
        return gcd(b, a%b)
```

This code defines a function `gcd` that takes two positive integers `a` and `b` as input and returns their GCD. It uses a loop to implement the recursive steps of Euclid's Algorithm. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the result.
