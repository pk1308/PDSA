The time complexity of the merge sort algorithm can be analyzed using the recurrence relation and its components. Let's break it down and then solve the recurrence relation to determine the overall complexity.

### Components of Merge Sort

1. **Base Case**: When the list has 0 or 1 element, the function returns immediately with O(1) time complexity.
2. **Splitting the List**: Dividing the list into two halves takes O(1) time since it only involves calculating the middle index and slicing the list.
3. **Recursive Calls**: The function makes two recursive calls, each with a list half the size of the original, leading to `2T(n/2)`.
4. **Merging**: Merging the two sorted halves takes O(n) time, where n is the total number of elements in the list.

### Recurrence Relation

The recurrence relation for merge sort can be written as:
\[ T(n) = 2T\left(\frac{n}{2}\right) + O(n) \]

### Solving the Recurrence Relation

We can solve this recurrence relation using the **Master Theorem** for divide-and-conquer recurrences of the form:
\[ T(n) = aT\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + f(n) \]

For merge sort:

- \( a = 2 \) (number of subproblems)
- \( b = 2 \) (each subproblem size is n/2)
- \( f(n) = O(n) \) (the cost of dividing and merging)

According to the Master Theorem, we compare \( f(n) \) with \( n^{\log_b{a}} \):

1. **Calculate \( \log_b{a} \)**:
   \[ \log_b{a} = \log_2{2} = 1 \]
2. **Compare \( f(n) \) with \( n^{\log_b{a}} \)**:

   - \( f(n) = O(n) \)
   - \( n^{\log_2{2}} = n^1 = n \)

Since \( f(n) \) is \( O(n) \) and \( n^{\log_2{2}} \) is also \( O(n) \), we are in case 2 of the Master Theorem, which states:

If \( f(n) = O(n^{\log_b{a}}) \), then:
\[ T(n) = O(n^{\log_b{a}} \log n) \]

Thus:
\[ T(n) = O(n \log n) \]

### Conclusion

The overall time complexity of merge sort is:
\[ T(n) = O(n \log n) \]

This complexity reflects the efficient performance of merge sort for large datasets, combining the divide-and-conquer approach with efficient merging, resulting in a logarithmic number of levels of recursion and linear work per level.
