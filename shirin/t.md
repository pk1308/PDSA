We have two relations (tables) R and S:


1. The question asks for the number of tuples in R ⟕ S, where ⟕ denotes a left outer join.
2. A left outer join includes all records from the left table (R) and the matched records from the right table (S). If there is no match, the result will contain null values for columns from the right table.
3. The join condition is on column B, which is common to both tables.
4. Let's perform the join:

   - For A=1, B=2: Matches with two rows in S (B=2)
   - For A=2, B=4: No match in S
   - For A=3, B=7: Matches with one row in S (B=7)
   - For A=4, B=3: Matches with one row in S (B=3)
5. Counting the results:

   - A=1 produces 2 rows
   - A=2 produces 1 row (with nulls for S columns)
   - A=3 produces 1 row
   - A=4 produces 1 row
6. Total number of tuples: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
