Analyzing DocumentsAnalyzing DocumentsThe table provided compares the time complexities and characteristics of four sorting algorithms: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quicksort. Let's explain the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for each algorithm:

### Selection Sort

- **Best Case: \(O(n^2)\)**
  - Even in the best case, Selection Sort performs \(O(n^2)\) comparisons because it always scans the entire list to find the minimum element.
- **Average Case: \(O(n^2)\)**
  - On average, Selection Sort will also perform \(O(n^2)\) comparisons and swaps.
- **Worst Case: \(O(n^2)\)**
  - The worst-case scenario is the same as the best and average cases, requiring \(O(n^2)\) comparisons and swaps.
- **In-place: Yes**
  - Selection Sort sorts the list in place without requiring additional storage.
- **Stable: No**
  - Selection Sort is not stable because it may change the relative order of equal elements.

### Insertion Sort

- **Best Case: \(O(n)\)**
  - The best case occurs when the array is already sorted, requiring only \(O(n)\) comparisons and no swaps.
- **Average Case: \(O(n^2)\)**
  - On average, Insertion Sort performs \(O(n^2)\) comparisons and swaps.
- **Worst Case: \(O(n^2)\)**
  - The worst case occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order, requiring \(O(n^2)\) comparisons and swaps.
- **In-place: Yes**
  - Insertion Sort sorts the list in place without requiring additional storage.
- **Stable: Yes**
  - Insertion Sort is stable because it maintains the relative order of equal elements.

### Merge Sort

- **Best Case: \(O(n \log n)\)**
  - Merge Sort always divides the array into halves and merges them, resulting in \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity in the best case.
- **Average Case: \(O(n \log n)\)**
  - On average, Merge Sort performs \(O(n \log n)\) comparisons and merges.
- **Worst Case: \(O(n \log n)\)**
  - The worst-case scenario is the same as the best and average cases, requiring \(O(n \log n)\) comparisons and merges.
- **In-place: No**
  - Merge Sort requires additional storage for the temporary arrays used during the merge process.
- **Stable: Yes**
  - Merge Sort is stable because it maintains the relative order of equal elements.

### Quicksort

- **Best Case: \(O(n \log n)\)**
  - The best case occurs when the pivot divides the array into two nearly equal halves, resulting in \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity.
- **Average Case: \(O(n \log n)\)**
  - On average, Quicksort performs \(O(n \log n)\) comparisons and swaps.
- **Worst Case: \(O(n^2)\)**
  - The worst case occurs when the pivot divides the array into two highly unbalanced parts, such as when the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot, resulting in \(O(n^2)\) time complexity.
- **In-place: Yes**
  - Quicksort sorts the list in place without requiring additional storage.
- **Stable: No**
  - Quicksort is not stable because it may change the relative order of equal elements.

### Summary

- **Selection Sort**: Consistently \(O(n^2)\) in all cases, in-place, not stable.
- **Insertion Sort**: Best case \(O(n)\), average and worst case \(O(n^2)\), in-place, stable.
- **Merge Sort**: Consistently \(O(n \log n)\) in all cases, not in-place, stable.
- **Quicksort**: Best and average case \(O(n \log n)\), worst case \(O(n^2)\), in-place, not stable.

Understanding these scenarios helps in choosing the appropriate sorting algorithm based on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.
